# Thoughts about the retrospective process
> To look back at events that have taken place and incorporate our successes and improvements into our daily work life.

### Some thoughts from my perpective
- As a person I’d prefer to get insight from someone’s real-life experiences, and from them going on the journey with me.
- As a person I’d like insight from someone I’ve worked with and can trust to be both candid and fair.
- As a person I’d like insight that is based in real-life examples rather than guesswork from afar.
- As a person I’d like suggestions or a coaching plan that lead to me growing as an individual.
- As a person I’d like to think that my growth/salary/promotion in Readify is not at the sole discretion of a single person.
- As a person I’d like my review to be based on several iterations, like an ongoing conversation, that way I feel like there’s been opportunity to grow and measure my growth.

### Some thoughts from my leader's perspective
- As a leader I’d prefer to provide insights for someone I’ve been working with closely, where I’ve experienced what it’s like going on the journey with them.
- As a leader I’d like this process to be centred around the person’s growth as an individual.
- As a leader I’d like (very much) not to be “milked” for information, but have it collected as a natural by-product of leading a person.
- As a leader I’d like to think that I’m not *solely* responsible for a person’s growth/salary/promotion in Readify.
- As a leader I’d like to think that decisions for a person’s growth/salary/promotion in Readify are based on an ongoing conversation, not a single instance.

## Thoughts about rating
- Consider rating ourselves at the **defining characteristics** level so it's not too hard to maintain over time
- The examples could be used as a frame of reference for the rating
- Change the terms...
  - No brainer: _You're great at this! We don't even need to talk about it._
  - Maturing: _Here's some suggestions, take them or leave them - it's your call._
    - It would make sense to record the suggestions.
  - Needs coaching: _This is an area you're weak in, let's work out a plan and walk this out together._
    - It would make sense to record the coaching plan.
- Call special attention to clearly outstanding/exemplary behaviour.
  - Outstanding: _You simply shine in this area like very few others. I think people deserve to know this about you._
